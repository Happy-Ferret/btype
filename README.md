# btype
## A fast language for the web

BType is a compiled, statically typed language for the web that doesn't get in
the way of day-to-day development.

## Goals

- Provide a language with the best features of JavaScript
- Compiled code should run faster than normal JavaScript
- Tools for accessing external JS utilities should be available
- You shouldn't need to worry about memory management
