## A fast language for the web

BType is a compiled, statically typed language for the web that doesn't get in
the way of day-to-day development.

At the time of writing, BType is still in an extremely early phase of development and should NOT be used for any production needs.


## Goals

- Provide a language with the best features of JavaScript, Python, etc.
- Compiled code should run faster than normal JavaScript
- Code should compile to a wide array of compile targets
- Tools for accessing external JS utilities should be available
- You shouldn't need to worry about memory management
- Should compile very quickly
- Code should minify exceptionally well


# Features

- Tree shaking
- Lexical scope
- First-class functions
- Compiles directly to asm.js
